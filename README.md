# Chicken in a Can
Using [Arch](https://github.com/archlinux) to write some software and [archiso](https://github.com/archlinux/archiso) to make some distros  

Projects are going to be a bit inconsistent, I'm kinda dumb sometimes

## Some of [my](https://github.com/Chicken-in-a-Can) Projects
 - [cscOS](https://github.com/Chicken-in-a-Can/cscOS): Persistent, Live-USB based Official OS of the MHS Comp-Sci Club
